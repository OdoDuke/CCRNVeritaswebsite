    <h1  >YOUR WELFARE - OUR CONCERN</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Jesus said that in following Him, we would gain a multiple portion of everything we had or had to give up including mothers, brothers, sisters.<br/> We are a family of many sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers and just like in a family, we deeply care about the well being of every member. <br/>Our concern is not only your spiritual health but your entire and holistic welfare as a young believer. <br/> We are interested in answering questions or assisting you through challenges/uncertainties that relate to your walk with God, academics, finances, relationships, emotional health, social life – you name it.</p>
